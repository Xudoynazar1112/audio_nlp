It's time to strap our boots on. This is a perfect day to die. Wipe the blood out of our eyes. In this life there's no surrender. There's nothing left for us to do. Find the strength to see this through. We are the ones who will never be broken. With our final breath. We'll fight to the death. We are soldiers. We are soldiers who? I stand here right beside you tonight. We're fighting for our lives. Let me hear your battle cry. Your battle cry. We are the ones who will never be broken. With our final breath. We'll fight to the death. We are soldiers. We are soldiers? We are the ones who will not go unspoken? No, we will not sleep. We are not sheep. We are soldiers. We are so. We stand shoulder to shoulder. We stand shoulder to shoulder. We stand shoulder to shoulder? You can erase us? You'll just have to face us. We stand shoulder to shoulder. We stand shoulder to shoulder. We stand shoulder to shoulder? You can raise us till just at the face of. We are the ones who will never be broken. With our final breath. We'll fight to the death. We are soldiers. We are sold. We are the ones who will not go unspoken? No, we will not sleep. We are not sheep. We are soldiers. We are soldiers. We are soldiers.
